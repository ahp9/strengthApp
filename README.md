## Individual project

This is a workout app made in React-Native with the use of Expo. No design was made by me, not a designer, which is why the design is bland and basic. The main reason was to be able to make a mobile app, that has guides, workouts, and exercises for a user. There is no database connected which means there is no interaction with the app, you can only open and see the information that is already there, and all the information that is put in doesn't do anything.

And you have to have Expo to run the app.
